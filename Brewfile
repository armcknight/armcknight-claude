# That target trusts the taps and then runs `brew bundle --file=Brewfile`. The
# trust step is required, not optional. Both taps are third-party, and Homebrew
# refuses to load formulae or casks from an untrusted tap — `brew bundle` aborts
# on the first one and installs nothing at all, including the entries below it.
#
# None of this is needed to install the plugin itself. As a plugin user, install
# only what the commands you actually use require — see the table in README.md.
