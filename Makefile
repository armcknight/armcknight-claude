# Both taps are third-party, and Homebrew refuses to load formulae or casks from
# an untrusted tap. `brew bundle` aborts on the first one it meets and installs
# nothing at all, including the entries after it, so trust precedes the bundle.
# Both commands are idempotent.
## init: trust the taps and install the dev toolchain from the Brewfile
init:
	brew trust --tap dorkitude/linctl
	brew trust --tap armcknight/tools
	brew bundle --file=Brewfile

# What CI runs. Catches manifest errors and, more usefully, command frontmatter
# that fails to parse — which otherwise loads silently with empty metadata.
## validate: check the plugin and marketplace manifests
validate:
	claude plugin validate $(PLUGIN)
	claude plugin validate .

## version: print the current plugin version
version:
	@echo $(VERSION)

## patch: bump the version in the manifest (also: minor, major)
patch minor major:
	vrsn $@ -f $(MANIFEST) -p '$(VERSION_PATTERN)'
	@echo "Bumped to $$(vrsn -r -f $(MANIFEST) -p '$(VERSION_PATTERN)'). Now run: make release"

# Bump first (make patch/minor/major), then release. The bump is the release as
# far as users are concerned: Claude Code tracks main and compares version
# strings, so a tag without a manifest bump moves nobody. prepare-release
# refuses when [Unreleased] is empty, which catches releasing nothing.
#
# Needs prepare-release 4.4.0 or later, for --pattern. Earlier versions accept
# only --key, which cannot read JSON: 4.3.0 takes the whole manifest as the
# version string and writes it into the changelog as a section heading before it
# fails. `make init` installs a new enough one.
#
# The GitHub release is left to CI, which the pushed tag triggers.
## release: migrate the changelog, commit, tag and push
release: validate
	prepare-release --file $(MANIFEST) --pattern '$(VERSION_PATTERN)' --changelog $(CHANGELOG) --push

## release-rc: same as release, but cut a release candidate
release-rc: validate
	prepare-release rc --file $(MANIFEST) --pattern '$(VERSION_PATTERN)' --changelog $(CHANGELOG) --push
